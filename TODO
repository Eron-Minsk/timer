1. Improved Timer Management
Individual Start/Pause Buttons: Right now, only a "START ALL TIMERS" button is available. Adding a "Start/Pause" button for each timer would allow for more precise control.
Visual Feedback for Running Timers: Add a visual cue, like a flashing border or icon, to indicate running timers. This could help differentiate active from paused or completed timers.
2. Responsive Timer Layout
Dynamic Sizing for Timers: As timers are added, each timer's size remains fixed, which might look cluttered with multiple timers. Add media queries to make timers more flexible and responsive (e.g., change from grid to vertical stack on smaller screens).
Scrollable Timer Container: Consider making #timers-container scrollable if the number of timers exceeds a certain count, especially on smaller screens.
3. Enhanced User Interface
Timer Color Coding: Color-code the timers based on time left (e.g., green for more than 10 minutes, yellow for under 10, red for under 5).
Venue Name Save Button Change: Change the "Set Venue" button to a save icon or even auto-save upon pressing Enter for better UX flow.
4. Input Validation and Feedback
Time Inputs as Dropdowns or Ranges: Instead of using number fields for hours/minutes, which can lead to manual typing errors, consider dropdown menus or range sliders, especially if time increments are predictable (e.g., 0.5-hour intervals).
Disable Start Button Until Timers Added: Right now, pressing the "START ALL TIMERS" button does nothing if no timers exist. Disable it until at least one timer is added.
5. Extra Functionality
Pause/Resume All Button: Alongside the "START ALL TIMERS," add a "PAUSE ALL" button for bulk control.
Export Timers and Venue Name: Add an export option that could save the timer configurations and venue name in JSON, CSV, or another file type for future use.
6. Code Improvements
Use Classes for Repeated Timer Styling: Rather than reassigning the timer classes multiple times (e.g., for warnings or finished states), consider making .timer-running, .timer-warning, and .timer-finished classes to apply them dynamically for a clearer CSS structure.
JavaScript Code Efficiency: Using a dictionary for each timer rather than an array of intervals would allow you to access individual timers by ID directly, making it easier to manage each interval without relying on array indexing.
